Build an interface to search and browse through the attached movie database.
https://gist.github.com/3022b00aead25810b794#file-use_the_force-json

Use MySQL as the backend database and PHP as the scripting language. If you wish to use a different technology stack, you are welcome, but discuss with your proctor/evaluator before starting. 

At a minimum, the interface is expected to allow the user to search for movies by
- Keywords (should search the title, plot, and director columns in one search)
- Genre (pick from a list of possible genres, show all movies in that genre)

You are at liberty to determine what elements from the database should be displayed on the individual movie pages.  At least show the poster, title, genre and director.

Aesthetics are not important but you are sure to earn some bonus points for good-looking pages.

Fork the repo and commit your work into the forked repo, logically breaking up commits as you progress.  We want to see how you think about your progress as you go along, not just the final result. 

Send us a pull request when you feel your work is ready. 

Expected Deliverables:
- The schema of the database (in .sql format or in .sql.tar.gz or similar format) - put this in the root of the repo 
- A small writeup about how the provided data was translated to the final schema.
- Codebase (comprising all files required to run the site on an apache or similar server)

We expect you to be vocal about issues you are running into. Log the issues you have on your fork's  issue queue. 

Reach out to kasisnu.singh@acquia.com, abhishek.anand@acquia.com and tanay.sai@acquia.com if you have any further technical queries. For everything else, reachout to parul.bhatt@acquia.com

All the very best and good luck.
